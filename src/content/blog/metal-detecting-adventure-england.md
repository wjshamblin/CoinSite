# A Week in the English Fields: Medieval Treasures Await

There's something magical about metal detecting in England—the history beneath your feet spans over two millennia, and every beep of your detector could reveal a piece of that incredible past. My 2013 metal detecting expedition to the Colchester area of Essex proved this point perfectly, yielding two fascinating medieval silver pennies that connected me directly to England's rich numismatic heritage.

## The First Find: Edward I Silver Penny (ca. 1305)

My heart rate spiked when my Garrett GTI-2500 gave that distinctive silver signal in a farmer's field near Colchester. After carefully excavating the target, I found myself holding a silver penny from the reign of Edward I, dating to approximately 1300-1310. The coin was a beautiful example of the "Long Cross" type, featuring the characteristic medieval portrait with what collectors affectionately call a "piggy little nose"—typical of the artistic style of the period.

This London mint penny represented the first coin I found during the trip, and what a start it was! Edward I, known as "Longshanks," ruled England from 1272 to 1307, and his coinage represents a significant period in English numismatic history. The Long Cross design was not only artistically significant but also served practical purposes, helping to prevent clipping—a common form of debasement where people would trim silver from the edges of coins.

## The Second Discovery: Charles I Hammered Penny (1642)

Later in the week, I discovered another silver penny, this time from the turbulent reign of Charles I. Dating to 1641-1643, this coin bore the distinctive 2 dots mintmark and represented the final period of English hammered coinage before the mechanized minting processes took over completely.

Finding a Charles I penny was particularly meaningful from a historical perspective. This coin was minted during the period leading up to the English Civil War, when the kingdom was in political turmoil. Charles I's reign ended with his execution in 1649, making this coin a tangible link to one of the most dramatic periods in English history.

## The Bigger Picture: Fellow Detectorists and Roman Finds

While my own finds were modest by some standards, the social aspect of metal detecting made the trip truly memorable. Other members of our detecting group found some spectacular pieces, including a fellow detectorist who discovered a Marcus Aurelius sestertius—a massive bronze Roman coin from the 2nd century AD. Seeing such finds firsthand reminded me why England is considered the holy grail for metal detectorists worldwide.

The Colchester area, ancient Camulodunum, was Britain's first Roman capital, so finding Roman coins in the area isn't unusual. What's remarkable is the continuity of finds spanning from Roman times through the medieval period and beyond. Each field seemed to hold layers of history, waiting to be discovered.

## Metal Detecting Ethics and Documentation

It's worth noting that all finds were properly documented with the Colchester Treasure Hunting club and reported according to British law. Responsible metal detecting requires permission from landowners, proper reporting of significant finds through the Portable Antiquities Scheme, and respectful treatment of archaeological sites.

The hobby has evolved significantly, with modern detectorists working closely with archaeologists and museums to preserve historical context while allowing people to connect directly with the past. Every properly recorded find adds to our understanding of historical settlement patterns, trade routes, and daily life in bygone eras.

## Reflections on the Hobby

Metal detecting offers a unique way to engage with history. Unlike museum pieces behind glass, these coins were once held by medieval merchants, farmers, and nobles. The Edward I penny might have purchased bread at a market in 1305, while the Charles I penny could have been in someone's purse as political tensions mounted in the 1640s.

The tactile connection to history that metal detecting provides is unmatched. When you hold a coin that was last touched hundreds of years ago, you become part of an unbroken chain of human connection stretching back through the centuries.

## Planning Your Own Adventure

For those inspired to try metal detecting in England, remember that proper permissions and research are essential. Join local clubs, study the laws and protocols, and always treat landowners and archaeological heritage with respect. The rewards—both in terms of finds and the connections you'll make with fellow enthusiasts—are immeasurable.

The English countryside holds countless stories beneath the surface, waiting for respectful and responsible detectorists to uncover them. Who knows what medieval treasure might be waiting for your next adventure?
